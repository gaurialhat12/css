    <p>Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a cunning tiger who had terrorized the jungle in his youth. As he grew older, he became weak and could no longer hunt. One day, he sat in an open area, displaying a gold bangle he had found, and called out to a passing man, claiming he wanted to give it away. The man, believing the tiger had turned over a new leaf, approached him. But the wicked tiger, true to his nature, seized the opportunity and killed the unsuspecting man.</p>
