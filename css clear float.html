    The Wise Little Sparrow

Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a little sparrow named Chikki. Chikki was small but very clever. One sunny morning, she saw a farmer spreading grains on the ground. Chikki was excited to eat but noticed something unusual—the grains were scattered near a big net. She realized it was a trap to catch birds. Instead of flying away, Chikki chirped loudly to warn other birds. "Don't eat the grains! It's a trap!" she cried. The other birds listened and stayed away. The farmer, seeing his plan fail, left in frustration. Chikki's quick thinking saved everyone, and the birds thanked her for her wisdom. From that day on, Chikki became a hero in the forest, teaching everyone the importance of being cautious and helping others.

Moral: Always think before you act, and never hesitate to help others in need.
